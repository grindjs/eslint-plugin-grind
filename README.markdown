# eslint-plugin-grind

A plugin for eslint that adds functionality to aid in conforming to Grind standards.

Currently it supports:
* Exposing Grindâ€™s built in globals
* [`empty-array`](lib/rules/empty-array.js) rule to enforce a single space between brackets in empty arrays
* [`empty-object`](lib/rules/empty-object.js) rule to enforce a single space between braces in empty objects
